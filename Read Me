Functionality of the code: 
The code predicts if an flight will be delayed using machine learning.
It employs a trained algorithm to create predictions based on input variables such as departure time, airline, weather conditions, and more.

User Run: 
Check that Python and any required libraries are installed.
Download the source code and data.
Open a command prompt,Â terminal or and IDE.
Go to the code's directory.
Use Radhey_Assignmentfile.py to run the code. 

User Output:

The code will then utilise the trained model to forecast whether or not the flight will be delayed.
This code will provide a analysis, Model comparision on the bases of the flight data
